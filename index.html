                <h2>Gin</h2>

                <p>
                    Most of the people think that Gin comes from England or Ireland. But it is not true! What
                    actually very few know: Gin is originally from the Netherlands. Since the Middle Ages people
                    knew about the medical effects and the disinfectant healing power of juniper berries which were
                    consumed to fight against fever and even the pest. The dutch doctor Franciscus Sylvius de la Boe
                    is the inventor of Gin. In the 16th century, he made a schnaps distilled with juniper berries,
                    so called “Genever” (in dutch: juniper berry) which was consumed for medical purposes. During
                    the Eighty Year’s War (1568-1648) the dutch soldiers were supposed to drink the “Genever” to
                    feel brave. In the 17th century “Genever” came to England, where the originally “Genever”
                    developed to the today’s “Gin”.

                <h2>Rum</h2>

                <p>
                    Originally, rum started out before it was even called rum. Way back before the word rum was
                    recorded, there was a drink referred to as “wine sugar.” Wine sugar was most likely the
                    beginning of rum back in the thirteen hundreds. While the word rum didn’t exist at the time,
                    wine sugar most likely was very like the first official rums. It may have been something
                    very rudimentary, but on a base level, it was, most likely, the rum origin.

                    The first recorded rum, however, came about in the West Indies around 1650. However, in
                    1650, these first rums were known on records from Barbados as “kill-devil” or “rumbullion.”
                    The name rum started to be used as the regular name in 1667. The beginning of rum is tied to
                    a dark part of history. Slaves were traded to the West Indies for molasses, and the molasses
                    was made into rum. Then, that rum was traded for more slaves.

                    These days, rum is made and distributed in a way we can be proud of. Many distilleries and
                    makers of rum run small operations. Rum may have gotten a start in the time of slavery, as
                    so many things did. However, the rum we drink today has come a long way.

                <h2>Vodka</h2>

                <p>
                    The word Vodka comes from the translation of water in Russian: “Voda”. On the other hand, the Polish
                    used the term to refer to any white distilled drink. Its birth brings us to the Middle Age, when it
                    started becoming popular. This liquor was produced from potatoes and had medicinal purposes. Experts
                    suggest that its use was common in Russia because it was an effective remedy against the cold
                    weather.

                    Curiously, the first to develop this distillate were monks, thanks to them, farmers of the
                    eighteenth century began to drink vodka and its use began to grow in Russia. However, this drink did
                    not begin to expand until 1917, during the Russian Revolution, in which the population began to
                    escape from the country towards Europe, and what did they bring with them? Their Voda or water.
                    However, the worldwide recognition of this drink did not arrive until the Second World War, the
                    historical moment when Vodka reaches the hands of the North Americans.

                <div class="tequila-info">
                    <h2>Tequila</h2>
                    <p>
                        The tequila we know and love today didn't start off the way we know it now. In its earliest
                        version,
                        it was known as pulque and was made from the fermented sap of the agave plant by the Aztec
                        civilization in what is now northern Mexico. According to Liquor.com, this same technique likely
                        dates back to 1000 B.C. and was used by the Olmecs an even more prehistoric Meso-American
                        civilization. Pulque was first documented via pictograms on stone walls around 200 A.D.
                        Many believe that the Spanish invasion of the Aztec civilization in the 1500s marks the
                        beginning of
                        a distillation process used for the agave plant to make tequila. When brandy supplies ran low,
                        Spaniards used mud and agave to create a drink (one more similar to modern-day mezcal). By the
                        early
                        1600s the Marquis of Altamira (a Spanish nobleman) built the first large-scale distillery in
                        what is
                        now Tequila, Jalisco. Jalisco is where the majority of tequila is produced to this day.

                    <h2>Whiskey</h2>

                    <p>
                        whiskey, also spelled whisky, any of several distilled liquors made from a fermented mash of
                        cereal
                        grains and including Scotch, Irish, and Canadian whiskeys and the various whiskeys of the United
                        States. Whiskey is always aged in wooden containers, usually of white oak. The name, spelled
                        without
                        an e by the Scots and Canadians and with an e in Ireland and the United States, comes from the
                        Celtic usquebaugh (Irish uisce beathadh, Scots Gaelic uisge beatha, both adaptations of the
                        Latin
                        phrase aqua vitae, meaning “water of life”). The earliest direct account of whiskey making is
                        found
                        in Scottish records dating from 1494.

                        The whiskeys produced in each country are distinctive in character because of differences in the
                        method of production, the type and character of the cereal grains, and the quality and character
                        of
                        the water employed.

                        Straight whiskeys are unmixed or mixed only with whiskey from the same distillation period and
                        distiller. Blended whiskeys include mixtures of similar products made by different distillers
                        and in
                        different periods (Scotch) and also whiskeys made with combinations of the neutral whiskeys
                        (which
                        have no distinctive flavour characteristics) and straight whiskeys (United States and Canada).
                        Small
                        quantities of other flavouring materials (e.g., sherry, fruit juices) may be included in blends.
                        Governments may require that some whiskeys be aged under their supervision for specific periods.
