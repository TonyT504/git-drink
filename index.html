                                                Most of the people think that Gin comes from England or Ireland. But it
                                                is not true!
                                                What
                                                actually very few know: Gin is originally from the Netherlands. Since

                                                Ages people
                                                knew about the medical effects and the disinfectant healing power of
                                                juniper berries
                                                which were
                                                consumed to fight against fever and even the pest. The dutch doctor
                                                Franciscus
                                                Sylvius de la Boe
                                                is the inventor of Gin. In the 16th century, he made a schnaps distilled
                                                with
                                                juniper berries,
                                                so called “Genever” (in dutch: juniper berry) which was consumed for
                                                medical
                                                purposes. During
                                                the Eighty Year’s War (1568-1648) the dutch soldiers were supposed to
                                                drink the
                                                “Genever” to
                                                feel brave. In the 17th century “Genever” came to England, where the
                                                originally
                                                “Genever”
                                                developed to the today’s “Gin”.

                                                Originally, rum started out before it was even called rum. Way back
                                                before the word
                                                rum was
                                                recorded, there was a drink referred to as “wine sugar.” Wine sugar was
                                                most likely
                                                the
                                                beginning of rum back in the thirteen hundreds. While the word rum
                                                didn’t exist at
                                                the time,
                                                wine sugar most likely was very like the first official rums. It may
                                                have been
                                                something
                                                very rudimentary, but on a base level, it was, most likely, the rum
                                                origin.

                                                The first recorded rum, however, came about in the West Indies around
                                                1650. However,
                                                in
                                                1650, these first rums were known on records from Barbados as
                                                “kill-devil” or
                                                “rumbullion.”
                                                The name rum started to be used as the regular name in 1667. The
                                                beginning of rum is
                                                tied to
                                                a dark part of history. Slaves were traded to the West Indies for
                                                molasses, and the
                                                molasses
                                                was made into rum. Then, that rum was traded for more slaves.

                                                These days, rum is made and distributed in a way we can be proud of.
                                                Many
                                                distilleries and
                                                makers of rum run small operations. Rum may have gotten a start in the
                                                time of
                                                slavery, as
                                                so many things did. However, the rum we drink today has come a long way.

                                                The word Vodka comes from the translation of water in Russian: “Voda”.
                                                On the other
                                                hand, the Polish
                                                used the term to refer to any white distilled drink. Its birth brings us
                                                to the
                                                Middle Age, when it
                                                started becoming popular. This liquor was produced from potatoes and had
                                                medicinal
                                                purposes. Experts
                                                suggest that its use was common in Russia because it was an effective
                                                remedy against
                                                the cold
                                                weather.

                                                Curiously, the first to develop this distillate were monks, thanks to
                                                them, farmers
                                                of the
                                                eighteenth century began to drink vodka and its use began to grow in
                                                Russia.
                                                However, this drink did
                                                not begin to expand until 1917, during the Russian Revolution, in which
                                                the
                                                population began to
                                                escape from the country towards Europe, and what did they bring with

                                            The tequila we know and love today didn't start off the way we know it now.

                                            earliest
                                            version,
                                            it was known as pulque and was made from the fermented sap of the agave
                                            plant by the
                                            Aztec
                                            civilization in what is now northern Mexico. According to Liquor.com, this
                                            same
                                            technique likely
                                            dates back to 1000 B.C. and was used by the Olmecs an even more prehistoric
                                            Meso-American
                                            civilization. Pulque was first documented via pictograms on stone walls
                                            around 200 A.D.
                                            Many believe that the Spanish invasion of the Aztec civilization in the
                                            1500s marks the
                                            beginning of
                                            a distillation process used for the agave plant to make tequila. When brandy
                                            supplies
                                            ran low,
                                            Spaniards used mud and agave to create a drink (one more similar to
                                            modern-day mezcal).
                                            By the
                                            early
                                            1600s the Marquis of Altamira (a Spanish nobleman) built the first
                                            large-scale
                                            distillery in
                                            what is
                                            now Tequila, Jalisco. Jalisco is where the majority of tequila is produced
                                            to this day.

                                            grains and including Scotch, Irish, and Canadian whiskeys and the various
                                            whiskeys of
                                            the United
                                            States. Whiskey is always aged in wooden containers, usually of white oak.

                                            in Scottish records dating from 1494.

                                            The whiskeys produced in each country are distinctive in character because
                                            of
                                            differences in the
                                            method of production, the type and character of the cereal grains, and the
                                            quality and
                                            character

                                            Straight whiskeys are unmixed or mixed only with whiskey from the same

                                            Governments may require that some whiskeys be aged under their supervision
                                            for specific
